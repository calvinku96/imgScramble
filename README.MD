General
====================

imgScramble divides the image into selected number of rows and columns and rearrange them according to the password. This provides a poor man's encryption for the image so that only people having access to the password are able to see the contents of the image. Although using encrytion solution that change the value of the image bit by bit is more secure, it cannot be decrypted after sharing through apps that uses jpeg compression. This is a why we choose to simply scramble the image as although there are minor artifacts, the whole image can still be reproduced regardless of the fact that it went through jpeg compression.


How to Scramble an Image
====================

1. Select the image you want to scramble (or optionally from camera).
2. Choose a password you want the scramble to be based on.
3. Choose how small the individual blocks you want to be by choosing the number of rows and columns.
4. You can also choose a random password, number of rows and number of columns.
5. Press Start.
6. You can choose the quality of the image to save (in JPEG).
7. Then you can save the image (by pressing the save button) and share (by pressing the share button).
8. Please remember all the necessary inputs to descramble the image.


How to Descramble an Image
====================

1. Select the image you want to descramble.
2. Fill in the necesary password, row and column.
3. If you receive the image from apps that uses JPEG compression, also fill in the Width and Height. Images that are not received from apps that usess JPEG compression does not need the Width and Height parameters.
4. Select Descramble and Start.
5. You then can view and/or save the image.
